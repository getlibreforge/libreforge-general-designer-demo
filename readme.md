# LibreForge Designer

To better understand the context it's recommended to start from reading the [LibreForge Framework Documentation](https://github.com/getlibreforge/libreforge-framework)

LibreForge Designer is another key pillar of LibreForge Platform. 
The Designer relies on proprietary components and is rather one of the least projects, which are not open source. The proprietary dependency is `@libreforge/libreforge-designer`.

Despite that the current project shows an example of how the client is able to spin up its own designer to make it available to the development team. See `development.md` for instructions.

An example of running Designer can be seen at https://getlibreforge.github.io/
